# Undirected Graph Explorations
A program in C and C++ which explore the attributes of undirected graphs. The program works with 500 random graphs for 1000 vertices (total 5000 per feature).
the features that were explored:
1. Connectivity
2. Diameter
3. Isolated

Using bfs in order to calculate the distance array from the given vertex to all other vertices.
In the end all the results were saved in a csv file.

Note: More remarks inside the cpp file.
